## Theory

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is branch of AI that helps machine to deal with human languages. Using NLP machine is able to understand, interpret, and manipulate human languages. You can simply understand NLP as relationship between AI, Human Lnaguage (Linguistics) and Computer Science

***How is the interaction between humans and machines done?***
```
  1. Human talks to machine
  2. Machine captures the audio
  3. Audio to text conversion
  4. Processing of text data
  5. Data to Audio conversion
  6. Machine respons to human through audio file
```

### Why NLP?, Need of NLP, How NLP works

* To understand NLP, we need to understand how a human language is structured.

  * Alphabets
  * Words - Combination of Alphabets
  * Sentence - Combination of words
  * Meaningful sentence - By applying grammar rules to sentence
  
* NLP is hallmark of human intelligence as it represents computer programs that understand text or speech.

* However we have a lot unstructured data gathered from numerous data sources and it needs to be understood and analyzed (Text Mining)

* NLP functionality involves four steps:

  * Sequence Pre-processing
  * Text to features
  * Usage of NLP models
  * Usage of NLP libraries

#### Categories of NLP

NLP can be categorized into two types:

  * ***Rule based NLP*** - Desgined by creating set of rules **(heuristic rules)**
  * ***Statistical NLP*** - Relies heavily on machine learning algorithms **(automatic learning procedure)**

#### Techniques used in NLP

There are two types of techniques used in NLP:

  * ***Semantic Analysis*** - Deals with **meaning of a text**, **understanding of sentence structure**
  * ***Syntactic Analysis*** - Focused on **arrangement of words**
  

#### Components of NLP

There are two types of components used in NLP:

  * ***Natural Language Understanding (NLU)*** - Taking **some sentences** and finding out **what they mean**
  * ***Natural Language Generation (NLG)*** - Finding a way to **represent sentence in a natural language format by using certain formal representation**
    * **Morphological Analysis**
    * **Syntactic Analysis**
    * **Semantic Analysis**
    * **Discourse Analysis**

#### NLP Pipeline

Before jumping to basics of NLP, let us check the NLP pipeline i.e. process from Data Acquisition to Monitoring and model updating process. The whole process is shown below:

## Basics of NLP

In this section of NLP, we will cover ***Text Cleaning and Text Processing*** that occurs generally in the intial steps of NLP pipeline after Data Acquisition
